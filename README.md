# Fast Fourier Transform for Convolution

In this project, we will test the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for convolution. The theory suggests that FFT is faster than the classic convolution, especially for large kernel sizes. We will validate this theory by comparing the execution time of FFT and direct convolution across various examples and presenting the benchmark results.
